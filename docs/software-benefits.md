# Software Benefits

The purpose of this Software is to assist the client in managing control of the flow of the planes at the airport. It prevents the airport from exceeding its capacity by checking the number of planes allowed to land according to the planes already at the airport. Additionally, it enables the client to adjust the airport's capacity as needed. In addition to the improvement in the control flow of the airport, the software must be reliable and any failure or downtime could result in disruptions to air traffic operations leading to potential delays.
